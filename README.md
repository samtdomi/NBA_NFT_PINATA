   1a. each nft is given its range of numbers out of 100 according to their percent chance of being drawn (Rajon -> 0-34, Rick -> 35-69, Allen -> 70-84, Lebron -> 85-94, Kobe 95 - 99)
   1b. save the requestId to the address that called it , make that the owner for the NFT selected from that requestID

create all functionality in the fulfillRandomWords function 2. Use the random number to select the specific NFT

3. save the NFT to its owners address

-   Deploy Script:
    -   Mocks

1. populate constructor chainlinkVRF variables

2. pin each nft image to IPFS using Pinata / generate IPFS hash for the image

3. fill out complete JSON Metadata for each NFT and include its IPFS image hash for its image: section

4. Pass in to the constructor an array of completed NFT metadata's in the correct order according to the smart contract
